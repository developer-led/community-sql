# Community SQL

Are you a developer community engineer? Or maybe a developer communty lead? If you're using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) as your community platform, like [OpenAI](https://community.openai.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/), [Cursor](https://forum.cursor.com/), [Cloudflare](https://community.cloudflare.com/) and many others, and at the same time you are on their *Business* or *Enterprise* [tier](https://www.discourse.org/pricing), you should better check out their **[Data Explorer](https://www.discourse.org/plugins/data-explorer)** plugin.

## What is Discourse Data Explorer

[Data Explorer](https://www.discourse.org/plugins/data-explorer) is basically a Discourse *plugin for running SQL queries against your database, allowing for instant stats reporting*. Those queries can be triggered manually via admin dashboard by your platform admin, or you can even build an automation for it and run a set of queries through an API from an external app. You basically turn on the plugin through your admin plugins page and then you can start creating them from scratch in the buil-in editor or import from a `json` file.

Additionally there are some queries for admin related stuff. The queries are grouped into three categories (`high-level`, `member-specific`, `admin`). 

Each query is commented so you can more easily understand it. Additionally there will be queries like measuring the number of active readers (and many others), which you can of course modify based on your own definition.
